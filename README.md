This site is a placeholder for the MakerDAO Peg Stability Module Stablecoin Ratio Trading App

It uses makerDAO's contracts to swap DAI on PulseChain for USDC, USDP, or GUSD at a 1:1 ratio or visa versa...

It also tells you the debt ceiling for those coins and how much DAI they have minted so far...

The App should be live soon...
